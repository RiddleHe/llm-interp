        "### Question:\nYou are given an integer array enemyEnergies denoting the energy values of various enemies.\nYou are also given an integer currentEnergy denoting the amount of energy you have initially.\nYou start with 0 points, and all the enemies are unmarked initially.\nYou can perform either of the following operations zero or multiple times to gain points:\n\nChoose an unmarked enemy, i, such that currentEnergy >= enemyEnergies[i]. By choosing this option:\n\n\t\nYou gain 1 point.\nYour energy is reduced by the enemy's energy, i.e. currentEnergy = currentEnergy - enemyEnergies[i].\n\n\nIf you have at least 1 point, you can choose an unmarked enemy, i. By choosing this option:\n\t\nYour energy increases by the enemy's energy, i.e. currentEnergy = currentEnergy + enemyEnergies[i].\nThe enemy i is marked.\n\n\n\nReturn an integer denoting the maximum points you can get in the end by optimally performing operations.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: enemyEnergies = [3,2,2], currentEnergy = 2\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nThe following operations can be performed to get 3 points, which is the maximum:\n\nFirst operation on enemy 1: points increases by 1, and currentEnergy decreases by 2. So, points = 1, and currentEnergy = 0.\nSecond operation on enemy 0: currentEnergy increases by 3, and enemy 0 is marked. So, points = 1, currentEnergy = 3, and marked enemies = [0].\nFirst operation on enemy 2: points increases by 1, and currentEnergy decreases by 2. So, points = 2, currentEnergy = 1, and marked enemies = [0].\nSecond operation on enemy 2: currentEnergy increases by 2, and enemy 2 is marked. So, points = 2, currentEnergy = 3, and marked enemies = [0, 2].\nFirst operation on enemy 1: points increases by 1, and currentEnergy decreases by 2. So, points = 3, currentEnergy = 1, and marked enemies = [0, 2].\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: enemyEnergies = [2], currentEnergy = 10\nOutput: 5\nExplanation: \nPerforming the first operation 5 times on enemy 0 results in the maximum number of points.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= enemyEnergies.length <= 10^5\n1 <= enemyEnergies[i] <= 10^9\n0 <= currentEnergy <= 10^9\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def maximumPoints(self, enemyEnergies: List[int], currentEnergy: int) -> int:\n        \n```\n\n### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\n\n",
        "### Question:\nAlice and Bob are playing a game on a string.\nYou are given a string s, Alice and Bob will take turns playing the following game where Alice starts first:\n\nOn Alice's turn, she has to remove any non-empty substring from s that contains an odd number of vowels.\nOn Bob's turn, he has to remove any non-empty substring from s that contains an even number of vowels.\n\nThe first player who cannot make a move on their turn loses the game. We assume that both Alice and Bob play optimally.\nReturn true if Alice wins the game, and false otherwise.\nThe English vowels are: a, e, i, o, and u.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"leetcoder\"\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nAlice can win the game as follows:\n\nAlice plays first, she can delete the underlined substring in s = \"leetcoder\" which contains 3 vowels. The resulting string is s = \"der\".\nBob plays second, he can delete the underlined substring in s = \"der\" which contains 0 vowels. The resulting string is s = \"er\".\nAlice plays third, she can delete the whole string s = \"er\" which contains 1 vowel.\nBob plays fourth, since the string is empty, there is no valid play for Bob. So Alice wins the game.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"bbcd\"\nOutput: false\nExplanation:\nThere is no valid play for Alice in her first turn, so Alice loses the game.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length <= 10^5\ns consists only of lowercase English letters.\n\n### Format: You will use the following starter code to write the solution to the problem and enclose your code within delimiters.\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def doesAliceWin(self, s: str) -> bool:\n        \n```\n\n### Answer: (use the provided format with backticks)\n\n"
